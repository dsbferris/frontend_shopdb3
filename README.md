A new Flutter project.  
~~Using [AppWrite](https://appwrite.io/) as backend service. (similar to firebase)~~  
Maybe AppWrite isn't the way to go, as it forces features that aim at full fledged production projects, which is more than we need.  
Seems like we gotta do our own.  
Using [Decimal](https://pub.dev/packages/decimal) for working with money values.
